**Problem Statement:**
The test in line 1 of the `MERGE-SORT` procedure reads "**if** $p \ge r$" rather than "**if** $p \neq r$". Argue that as long as the initial call of `MERGE-SORT(A, 1, n)` has $n \ge 1$, the test "**if** $p \neq r$" suffices to ensure that no recursive call has $p > r$.

### Proof

**Premise:**
We assume the procedure is currently executing with parameters $p$ and $r$ such that $p < r$. This is guaranteed because if $p = r$, the condition $p \neq r$ fails and the function returns immediately.

Let the midpoint be defined as:
$$
q = \left\lfloor \frac{p+r}{2} \right\rfloor
$$

The procedure makes two recursive calls: `MERGE-SORT(A, p, q)` and `MERGE-SORT(A, q+1, r)`. We must prove that for both calls, the start index is less than or equal to the end index.

#### 1. Lower Bound Analysis (First Call)
We must show that the range $[p, q]$ is valid, i.e., $p \le q$.

Since $p < r$, we have:
$$
\begin{align}
p &< r \\
2p &< p + r \\
p &< \frac{p+r}{2}
\end{align}
$$
Since $p$ is an integer, $p \le \lfloor \frac{p+r}{2} \rfloor$.
$$
\boxed{p \le q}
$$
Thus, the first recursive call never passes parameters such that start $>$ end.

#### 2. Upper Bound Analysis (Second Call)
We must show that the range $[q+1, r]$ is valid, i.e., $q+1 \le r$.

Since $p < r$, we have:
$$
\begin{align}
p &< r \\
p + r &< 2r \\
\frac{p+r}{2} &< r
\end{align}
$$
Using the property of the floor function for integers: if $x < r$, then $\lfloor x \rfloor \le r - 1$.
$$
\begin{align}
\left\lfloor \frac{p+r}{2} \right\rfloor &\le r - 1 \\
q &\le r - 1
\end{align}
$$
Which implies:
$$
\boxed{q + 1 \le r}
$$
Thus, the second recursive call never passes parameters such that start $>$ end.

**Conclusion:**
Since $p \le q$ and $q+1 \le r$, the condition $p \neq r$ is sufficient to prevent infinite recursion or invalid array indexing where $p > r$.
