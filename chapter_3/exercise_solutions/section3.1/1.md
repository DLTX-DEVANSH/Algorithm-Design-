**let's say the partition is done in chunk of n/5**

then the largest n/5 elements in the first n/5 positions need to traverse at least

$$
n-2\frac{n}5 = 3\frac{n}5
$$

so in worst case the number of iteration is at least proportional to 

$$
(\frac{n}5)(3\frac{n}5) = 3\frac{n^2}5
$$

hence the 

$$
\Omega(n^2) 
$$
