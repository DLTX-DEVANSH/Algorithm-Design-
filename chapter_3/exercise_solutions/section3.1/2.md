Big-O notation 
outer loop has $n-1$ iterations and inner loop has $n-j = n-i-1$ iterations that means the inner loop can run at most $n-1$ times when $i=0$ 
so the total number of iterations of inner loop is at most $(n-1)(n-1)$ times and hence $O(n^2)$ 

$\Omega$ notation 
assume to iterate the first n/3 largest elements in the firs n/3 position in the worst time to reach it's final position   needs to pass the middle n/3 elements . 
hence the inner loop is at least proportional to $(\frac{n}3)(\frac{n}3) = \frac{n^2}9$ hence
 
$$
\Omega(n^2)
$$
and hence 
$$
\Theta(n^2)
$$
